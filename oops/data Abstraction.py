#what is data abstration ?
'''
At its heart, data abstraction in Python is about simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem. It hides the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. Think of it as a way to define and manage the attributes and methods of objects in a more user-friendly way. It‚Äôs like seeing a car as a whole without worrying about each individual screw and bolt that holds it together.

In Python, you achieve data abstraction primarily through classes and objects. This keeps the details hidden and the user interfaces simple and efficient. üöó‚ûùüß©üöó

Want to dive deeper into classes and objects, or shall we shift gears to something else?'''

#Example:

'''from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Usage
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
print(dog.make_sound())  # Woof!
print(cat.make_sound())  # Meow!'''

#1.Create an abstract class LibraryItem that:

"""Has attributes: title, author, item_id.
Contains the following abstract methods:
check_out(): To check out an item.
return_item(): To return an item.
get_details(): To display the details of the item."""
'''
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class LibraryItem(ABC):
    def __init__(self, title, author, item_id):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.item_id = item_id
        self.is_checked_out = False  # Keeps track of whether the item is checked out or not
    
    @abstractmethod
    def check_out(self):
        """To check out an item."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def return_item(self):

        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_details(self):
        """To display the details of the item."""
        pass'''

# Now you can create subclasses like Book and Magazine which will inherit from LibraryItem

#2.Create two subclasses of LibraryItem:

Implements the abstract methods.'''
#Magazine:
'''Additional attributes: issue_number, publication_date.
