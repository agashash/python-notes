#1. What are the different modes for opening a file in Python?
   
""" 
In Python, you can open files in various modes:

'r': Read (default mode).
'w': Write (creates a new file or truncates an existing file).
'a': Append (adds to an existing file).
'b': Binary mode.
'x': Exclusive creation (fails if the file already exists). 
"""
""" 
file=open('file_name.txt','x')
file.write("hi,how are u?")
file.close() 
"""

#2.How do you read the entire content of a file into a string?

"""
file=open('file_name.txt','r')
a=file.read()
print(a) 
"""

#3.How can you read a file line by line?

""" 
file=open('file_name.txt','r')
read=file.readlines()
print(read[0:2]) 
"""

#4.What is the difference between read(), readline(), and readlines()?

'read(): Reads the entire file at once.'
'readline(): Reads the next line from the file.'
'readlines(): Reads all lines into a list.'

#5.How do you write to a file in Python?
"""

#6.What is the purpose of using a with statement when handling files?

' The with statement ensures proper acquisition and release of resources. It automatically closes the file after the block is executed, even if an error occurs.'

#7. How does using with open(...) as ...: improve file handling?
